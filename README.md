# AVR-Measure-VCC-Battery-Voltage-Without-Using-I-O-Pin-on-tinyAVR-and-mega-AVR
Atmel's days, the community has succeeded with this trick, but until Microchip acquired &amp; merged and published the APP note, there is no code available.  

Microchip AN2447 [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00002447A.pdf](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00002447A.pdf)  

there is a example and code available [https://wp.josh.com/2014/11/06/battery-fuel-guage-with-zero-parts-and-zero-pins-on-avr/](https://wp.josh.com/2014/11/06/battery-fuel-guage-with-zero-parts-and-zero-pins-on-avr/)

Test on ATmega168p

The Theory, make it more simple and straight.

Vbg = 1.1V, the internal voltage referrence
VCC = battery voltage
ADC value =
