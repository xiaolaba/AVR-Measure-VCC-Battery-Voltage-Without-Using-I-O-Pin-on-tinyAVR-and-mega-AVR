  This is a simplified demonstration of how to detect power supply voltage by using the on chip 
  analog-to-digital converter to measure the voltage of the internal band-gap reference voltage. 
 
  The code will read the current power supply voltage, and then blink an LED attached to pin 6 (PA7). 
 
  1 blink  = 1 volts = Vcc  2 volts	(only applicable on low voltage parts like ATTINY84AV)
  2 blinks = 2 volts = Vcc  3 volts 
  2 blinks = 2 volts = Vcc  3 volts
  3 blinks = 3 volts = Vcc  4 volts
  4 blinks = 4 volts = Vcc  5 volts
  5 blinks = 5 volts = Vcc  
 
  0 blinks = power supply turned off ) 
 
  This code was tested on an ATTINY84A with default fuse settings, but should work unchanged on 
  any ATTINYx4 or ATTINYx4A, and should be easily ported to any 8-bit AVR with ADC and internal 1.1 reference voltage.

Comments in slashasterisk form are quoted from the datasheet


The device is shipped with CKSEL = ¡§0010¡¨, SUT = ¡§10¡¨, and CKDIV8 programmed. The default
clock source setting is therefore the Internal Oscillator running at 8.0 MHz with longest start-up
time and an initial system clock prescaling of 8, resulting in 1.0 MHz system clock.

#include utildelay.h


 Returns the current Vcc voltage as a fixed point number with 1 implied decimal places, i.e.
 50 = 5 volts, 25 = 2.5 volts,  19 = 1.9 volts

 On each reading we enable the ADC, take the measurement, and then disable the ADC for power savings.
 This takes 1ms becuase the internal reference voltage must stabilize each time the ADC is enabled.
 For faster readings, you could initialize once, and then take multiple fast readings, just make sure to
 disable the ADC before going to sleep so you don't waste power.

	By default, the successive approximation circuitry requires an input clock frequency between 50

		After switching to internal voltage reference the ADC requires a settling time of 1ms before
		measurements are stable. Conversions starting before this may not be reliable. The ADC must

		After the conversion is complete (ADIF is high), the conversion result can be found in the ADC
		Result Registers (ADCL, ADCH).		
		
		When an ADC conversion is complete, the result is found in these two registers.
		When ADCL is read, the ADC Data Register is not updated until ADCH is read.

		Note that the ADC will not automatically be turned off when entering other sleep modes than Idle

		sleep modes to avoid excessive power consumption.
